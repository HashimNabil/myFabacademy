<h2 id="week-7-computer-controlled-machining"><strong><em>Week 7: Computer Controlled Machining</em></strong></h2>
<h3 id="the-assignment"><strong><em>The Assignment</em></strong></h3>
<p>To design and machine something big using computer controlled machining. I used Shopbot PRS Alpha that we have at FabLab UAE to complete this assignment.</p>
<h3 id="the-design"><strong><em>The Design</em></strong></h3>
<p>I designed a holder for my final project, <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabuae/students/154/final_project/finalproject.html">Fab Rover</a> as I was using chairs to raise it up so I can program the motors or assemble the frame as seen in the image below:</p>

</p>
<p>So I used fusion 360 to design a custom holder for the rover. It consists of 5 parts, one main body and four legs. I used dogbones for the holes where the legs will be assembled to as this techniques is very famous in CNC world as it helps in easing the assembly operation.</p>

<h3 id="fabrication"><strong><em>Fabrication</em></strong></h3>
<p>To fabricate the design, first, I saved the two main sketches which are the main support and the leg as DXF format. Then I opened <a href="http://www.vectric.com/products/vcarve.htm">VCarve Pro</a> software that comes with the shopbot to generate the toolpath. First, I started with the pocket toolpath, of the letter &quot;H&quot; that is in the center of the main board. Then I generated the toolpath of the inside cuts of the dog bone joints as well as the unnecessary areas that are aimed to decrease the weight of the item.</p>
<p>After opening VCarv, I sat up the material dimensions to be 2440 x 1220 x 18 mm then I loaded the DXF file. I needed to join some open vectors before placing the parts in their place on the material. Then I started by the pocket toolpath of the text as shown below:</p>

</p>
<p>Then I made a toolpath for the inner cuts as well as the outer cuts. For the outer cuts, I added taps that help in keeping the cut piece in its place while the tool is cutting but I did not do that for the inner cuts as I don't care about these pieces.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>I used 6 mm down cut bit with 14000 RPM, 60 mm/s feedrate speed, 3 mm pass depth and 2.4 mm stepover for all the toolpaths as shown below:</p>

</p>
<p>I used 17.6 mm plywood as the raw material of my project. I started with mounting it to the base of sacrificial layer of the machine using clamps. Then I centered the tool at the edge of the machine and with an offset from the edges so it will not hit the clamps.</p>

</p>
<p>Then I switched on the machine and pressed the &quot;Reset Button&quot; and loaded the toolpath file from VCARV to the machine and pressed the &quot;cut part&quot; button, then I switched on the spindle and started a dry run where the machine was moving on the air just to ensure that the tool will not hit any of the clamps. After that I started the real job as you can see in the videos below:</p>

<p>After cutting the parts, I sanded them using the sanding machine to remove the residuals and make them smoother, then I assembled them as shown below:</p>

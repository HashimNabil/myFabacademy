<h2 id="week-19-project-development"><strong><em>Week 19: Project Development</em></strong></h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-deadline-how-much-time-do-i-have-left"><strong><em>What is the deadline? How much time do I have left?</em></strong></h3>
<p>The deadline is at 28/6//2017. But I am writing this after I passed the deadline. As I spent more time in technical parts of the project, it was a very difficult situation</p>
<h3 id="what-tasks-have-been-completed-and-what-tasks-remain"><strong><em>What tasks have been completed, and what tasks remain?</em></strong></h3>
<p>I finished desinging, fabricating and assembling the mechanical design which consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 3D printed wheels.</li>
<li>laser cut frame.</li>
<li>3D printed differential</li>
</ul>
<p>I also finished the electronic design and production of the electronic boards of the project which are 6 boards, one for each wheel and the main board which has bluetooth.</p>
<p>The interface program of the project is almost done with its beta stage. And I am also done with programing the DC motors.</p>
<p>What is remaining is linking the main board to one of the nodes to test the serial communication as I tried I2C and I could not implement it.</p>
<p>In addition, I need to debug the servo connections as the servo don't work well. I also need to replace the conical screws with flat ones to increase the stability of the frame and I need to replace two bearings with two holes of the rocker bogie linkage.</p>
<h3 id="what-has-worked-what-hasnt"><strong><em>What has worked? What hasn't?</em></strong></h3>
<p>The blutooth to serial communication from the app to the main board worked but I need to make communication between the main board and the nodes. The DC motors are working just fine while I need to debug the servo connection of the boards. I am also missing voltage regulators and I need to buy as only one board has a working voltage regulator. Over all, I learned a lot from doing this project, and I will fix these issues later on to make the project work as I expected.</p>
<p>The differential system worked just fine and I am happy with that as I am electrical engineer and the aim of this project is to learn more about mechanical engineering so I focused more in these areas of the project.</p>
<h3 id="what-questions-need-to-be-resolved"><strong><em>What questions need to be resolved?</em></strong></h3>
<p>After implementing this project I realized that I should do it with iteration instead on focusing on the design, as I discovered a lot of things after assembling the project such as the need of using different type of screws, chaninge the maain bearing of the rocker and bogie joints to a hole with nut as well as strenghting the servo connection to the wheels. I also need to learn about I2C for future consideration as my boards are I2C ready but I can use them for serial communication which what I will do.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-happen-when"><strong><em>What will happen when?</em></strong></h3>
<p>I will fix the mechanical design and use serial communication instead of I2C for now but I will use I2C in the future.</p>
<h3 id="what-have-you-learned"><strong><em>What have you learned?</em></strong></h3>
<p>I learned many things and the most important thing is the significant importance of &quot;iterative design&quot; that I will try to do for the rest of the project that I will do in the future.</p>

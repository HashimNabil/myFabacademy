<h2 id="week-14-composites"><strong><em>Week 14: Composites</em></strong></h2>
<p>This week assignment requires us to ready the material safety datasheet and the technical datasheet of the resins that we are going to use and to design and fabricate a 3D mold and make a composite out of it.</p>
<h3 id="mold-design"><strong><em>Mold Design</em></strong></h3>
<p>I used Fusion 360 to design the mold. It is a semi sphere mounted on the top of thin box and has the letter &quot;H&quot; at the top.</p>

</p>
<p>I considered the height of the blue foam that we have which is 5 cm so the height of my mold is also 5 cm so I will need only one piece of foam to fabricate the mold.</p>
<h3 id="mold-fabrication"><strong><em>Mold Fabrication</em></strong></h3>
<p>First I exported the STL file from fusion360 then I opened it in VCarv Pro- ShopBot Edition. I made the working area to be 400 x 400 mm and thickness to be 50 mm which is the same thickness of the foam.</p>
<p>Then I made the first tool path which is the roughing toolpath with a spindle speed of 12000 RPM, 0.5 inch of stepover and a crazy feedrate speed of 150 mm/s. Well it was the time that we need to go out to have breakfast and it was foam after all so why not!</p>

<p>The below video shows the beginning of the roughing operation with the super fast feedrate speed!</p>

</p>
<p>The second toolpath was the finishing toolpath which I used the 1/4 inch ball nose bit with a spindle speed of 12000 RPM, 0.1 inch of stepover and the same super fast 150 mm/s feerate speed.</p>

<p>Then I used sanding paper to finish it as shown in the below image:</p>

<p>The final mold is shown below:</p>

<h3 id="making-the-composite"><strong><em>Making the Composite</em></strong></h3>
<p>We sourced the resin locally, the product name is D.E.R. 331 Liquid Epoxy Resin. I attached the <a href="datasheet.pdf">datasheet</a> to my archive. According to the datasheet, it is a liquid epoxy resin that is a liquid reaction product of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epichlorohydrin">epichlorohydrin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A">bisphenol A</a>.</p>
<p>The hardener was <a href="hardner.pdf">Aradur 42</a> and it came with a containers of 1 KG while the epoxy resin came with a container of 5 KG so we thought that the mix ration is 1 to 5. The material safety datasheet can be found <a href="safety.pdf">here</a>. I wore a lab coat, thick plastic gloves and face mask during making the composite.</p>
<p>I cut two soft sackcloth in a way that their fabric grain is in opposite directions to increase the strength of the composite and two hard sackcloth as shown below:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="cloth1.JPG" />
</p>
<p>I used scissor to cut and I should have flatten the 3D object first then laser cut the 2D design. However, I did not have time to do this and my design was simple.</p>
<p>Then I prepare the setup as seen below:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="setup.JPG" />
</p>
<p>After that mixed the epoxy resin with the hardener using a small container as shown below:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="compositex.JPG" />
</p>
<p>Then I continued to mix them for more than 10 min until the mix became a bit hard and all the hardener mixed well with the epoxy. After that I applied the plastic film on the mold so it will not stick with the composite. Then I put the first layer of the sackcloth in the mixture and rinse with it then carefully twisted on top of the mixture so the residuals will fall in the container.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
Finally, I placed the first layer at the mold followed by the second and third layers which were made of the hard sackcloth and I put them in a way so their fabric grain is in opposite direction. Then I applied another layer of plastic film to prevent the vacuum bag from sticking to the composite.

</p>
<p>After finishing making the composite, I put it in a vacuum bag and used the vacuum cleaner to pull out all the air so all the parts of the composites are stick to each other and to the mold.</p>

<p>Then I let dry for 2 days and the end results can be shown below:</p>

<h3 id="the-conclusion"><strong><em>The Conclusion</em></strong></h3>
<p>I learned how to make composites and I did make one, well not the best one out there but I learned the workflow so I think I will try better composites after fabacademy to improve this skill. In the end I want to thank Francisco, <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabuae/students/163/">Muadh</a> for helping me in making the mold and the composite.</p>
<p>I want also to note that I got the material safety datasheet from <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabuae/students/256/w14.html">Ahmed Najeeb</a> Archive.</p>

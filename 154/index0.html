<h1 id="hashim-nabil-al-sakkaf">Hashim Nabil Al Sakkaf</h1>
<p>I am an electrical engineering by profession, maker and open source enthusiastic by passion! I work at FabLab UAE, which is the first educational FabLab in UAE. My goal from joining fabacademy is to learn as much as I can specially using open source software, so I will try to stick to using open soruce software all over fabacademy.</p>
<h2 id="my-final-project-anyaxes">My Final Project : anyAxes</h2>
<p>anyAxes is a modular mechatronics joints that can be attached to each other to form different form of multimple axes machines such as CNCs or robotic arm.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="project2.jpeg" />
</p>
<p>Each anyAxes joint consists of motor connected to one rotating actuator which in turns connected to a rotating end effector via a timing belt where another liner motion end effector (E) will be connected, on the other hand, a metalic end effector will be connected to the other side of the belt (F), the F end effector is always touch a graphite plate, this plate is used as potentiometer as its resistance is measured between one point and the F end effector using a voltage divider method.</p>
<p>So the end result of the project will be a modular joints that can be connected in different ways, with live feedback, so the user will able to see the position of the end point effector live on his computer as I am planing to display these joints feedback readings using software GUI interface such as python or processing with forward and inverskinimatics so the user does not need to worry about such complex programming and start desinging machines on the go.</p>
<p>The idea of using pencile graphite with a timing belt is to simulate the function of linear potentiometer and I will try to make all the parts from what I will learn during fabacademy.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-the-world-of-version-control">Exploring the World of Version Control</h2>
<p>The first time I used version control systems such as git, it seemed complex and time wasting for me at the begining, but after I tried <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> I changed my mind, specially when our Guru, Mr Fransisco stated that you can work from any computer even if it is not yours as you can download your files from internet and place them in your desktop which is called &quot;cloning&quot; and start editing them right away! On top of that he stated that you can automate all of these process which seemed interesting to me.</p>
<h3 id="github">Github</h3>
<p>To practice using github and to be familiar with it, we used it before the academy so we created an organization for our fablab as shown below:</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>and we created several repositories inside it such as machines and projects, the idea was to get familiar with github. And I want to mention that it is my first time to use lnix, and I think I am going to use it for the rest of my life!</p>
<h3 id="gitlab">GitLab</h3>
<p>This year Fabacademy documentation is based on GitLab which is similar to github but has other <a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/gitlab-vs-github-how-are-they-different/">advantages</a>. To start pulling and pushing, I needed to the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regisiter in <a href="http://git.fabacademy.org/users/sign_in">Fabacademy archive</a> using my <a href="fablabs.io" class="uri">fablabs.io</a> account.</li>
<li>Adding my ssh key to my profile settings.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
<img src="ssh.jpeg" />
</p>
<ul>
<li>cloning the lab archive.</li>
<li>adding my identity</li>
<li>pulling and pushing to my file (154)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-the-website">Creating the Website</h2>
<p>I used a free bootstrap HTML5 template to create this website as I don't have enough experience in HTML or CSS programming and I don't want to consume a lot of time learing them from scratch besides &quot;Open Source is Love&quot;. The template I used is <a href="https://shapebootstrap.net/item/1524990-cyprass-html5-responsive-business-template">Cyprass</a> from <a href="https://shapebootstrap.net/">ShareBoots</a>, It is one page template that I edited its source code using Atom text editor(for now, now = Tuesday, 31017, 6:20 pm) and I am using web browser to review the results after editing as Atom does not support live preview for HTML as for my knowledge, I tried searching online for an extention to have live preview in atom for HTML but I dit not find thus I started editing the HTML source code of the template by Spliting the screen between atom and chrome to check the preview of the edited template, I had to save and refresh each time I want to see the edits. The picture below shows my work flow as for now (30 min from the previos &quot;now&quot;):</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="atomhtml.jpeg" />

</div>
I was learning HTML on the go, as I used <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> website to learn HTML coding so I can edit the template source code for example, the below code was linked with logo of the template which was located at the top right of the page:
<p align="center">
<pre><code>![](htmlcodebrakets.jpeg)</code></pre>
</p>
<p>By the way, I am writing this documentation using Atom editor, and markdown mixed with HTML to make life easy, as I found that markdown is super easy and fast tool to write documentation in HTML but I still use some HTML commands to do things I don't how to do in markdown, as searching for HTML syntax is much easier and I always end up with what I am looking for, lets take the above picture as an example, I did not know how to center it in markdown and I searched and I found the answer in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12090472/github-readme-md-center-image">stackoverflow</a> question so I just used raw HTML to do that as shown below:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="rawhtmlmarkdown.jpeg" />
</p>
<p>you will notice &quot;brackets&quot; up there, yes I download <a href="http://brackets.io/">brackets</a> which is an open source text editor by Adobe, I also installed <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and I was using all of them at the same time, I was using Atom for editing this page in particular as well as the HTML code of the template, while I used brackets for opening the original HTML code of the template so I can compare between it and the one I edited. It supposed to have live preview as shown in the picute below:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="bracketslivepreviw.jpeg" />
</p>
<p>But I was getting Error Launcing Browser, so I went to their <a href="https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Troubleshooting#-live-preview-isnt-working">troubloshooting</a> page and found that restarting the computer might solve the issue, so I did and it did not solve the issue, then I tried the settings of the software and it turned that I need to check the option of &quot;Enable Expremintal Live Preview&quot; as shown below:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="liveprevbrackets.jpeg" />
</p>
<p>So I diecided to use brackets for editing HTML codes such as the source code of the template as live preview proved to be quite faster as I don't have to press &quot;ctr+s&quot; then refresh the browser to notice the changes that I made in the HTML code, thanks to live preview! and In top of that, when you point at any place on the HTML code you will see the part that it controls highlighted in the live preview as shown below:</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="bracketsliveedit.jpeg" />
</p>
<p>I was pointing at one of the tabs located at the top of the homepage &quot;Aboute Me&quot; in the HTML code and I can see its location instantly in the live preview of the website, in the same way I can see the location of the section that I am pointing at the HTML code in the live preview of the website and this is quite useful, now I reget that I was using Atom for deleting the sections that I don't need from the template, for now (1/2/2016, 2:15 AM)</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="nightwork.jpeg" />
</p>
<p>I experienced 3 text editors Atom, sublimetext and brackets and I think that I will be using Atom for creating HTML content (via markdown) and brackets for editing HTML as its live preview proved to be quite handy for me. For sublimetext, I did not notice a big different between it and Atom as some reviews concluded that sublimetext is better than Atom but I think the oppiste is true, maybe I did not experience it a lot and I am not that good at both so I might change my mind in the future!</p>
